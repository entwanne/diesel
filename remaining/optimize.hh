/*** This class performs AST optimisation. Currently it only implements a
     very simple optimisation known as constant folding, which means that it
     tries to evaluate a binary operation node such as 2 + 5 during compiling,
     replacing it with a single integer node with value 7, or an expression
     only involving constants, such as (assuming FOO = 2) 4 + FOO, replacing
     the + node with an integer node with the value 6. ***/
